# Introduction
ðŸ“Š The "Investigating Patterns in 120 Years of Olympic Data" project involved the extraction, cleaning, and manipulation of Olympic Games dataset sourced from Kaggle. Using Excel for initial cleaning and MySQL for data preparation, normalization, and analysis, the project aimed to derive insights into Olympic performance metrics, including regional medal distribution, athlete achievements, and trends over time.


# Background
**Objective:** The objective of the project is to analyze and derive insights from historical Olympic Games data spanning 120 years. The project involves acquiring, cleaning, and manipulating data from Kaggle using Excel, followed by importing the processed data into a MySQL database. The focus of the analysis is to gain a comprehensive understanding of Olympic performance, including identifying regions with the most medals, analyzing medals by season and gender, identifying top medal-winning athletes, exploring regions' consistent participation across Olympic events, recognizing regions that consistently win gold medals, examining average age and medal distribution by gender and year, identifying the year with the most medals won, and determining the regions that have participated in every Olympic Games.


## Tools Used
For my deep dive into the analysis, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis and was the primary tool used for querying and analyzing the dataset.
- **MySQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for doing such kind of analysis.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.


# Project Phases:

### 1. Data Extraction and Preparation:
Acquire raw Olympic Games dataset from Kaggle and use Excel for initial cleaning. Conducted data cleaning in Excel, addressing inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues.

### 2. Data Import and Normalization in MySQL:
Imported cleaned data into MySQL for further data preparation, normalization, and analysis. Conducted data normalization to improve performance and reduce redundancy, ensuring efficient querying.

### 3. SQL Analysis with Advanced Functionalities:
Utilized a range of SQL functionalities for in-depth analysis:
- **Basic SELECT, WHERE, FROM Commands:** Extracted specific data subsets based on conditions.
- **Advanced GROUP BY, HAVING:** Conducted group-wise aggregations and filtering.
- **Common Table Expressions (CTE):** Created temporary result sets for complex queries.
- **Joins and Subqueries:** Combined data from multiple tables and performed nested queries.
- **Window Functions (SUM, AVG, RANK, ROW_NUMBER, LEAD, LAG):** Calculated aggregated values and performed ranking and analytical operations.

### 4. Key Features and Insights:
- **Regions with Most Medals:** Identified regions with the highest medal counts across all Olympic Games.
- **Medals by Season:** Visualized and analyzed medal distributions in Summer and Winter Olympics.
- **Medals by Gender:** Explored gender-based medal distributions to identify patterns.
- **Top Medal-Winning Athletes:** Recognized athletes with the most Olympic medals. Regions Participated in Every Olympic: Identified regions that consistently participated in every Olympic Games.
- **Regions Winning Gold in Every Olympic:** Recognized regions with a consistent record of winning gold medals.
- **Average Age and Medal Distribution by Gender and Year:** Analyzed average athlete age and medal distribution trends over time.
- **Year with Most Medals Won:** Identified the Olympic year with the highest overall medal count.
- **Regions Participated:** Explored regions participating in each Olympic year.
